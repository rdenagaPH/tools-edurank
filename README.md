## üéØ Overview

**EduRank** is a sophisticated web-based application designed for educators to evaluate and rank student coding projects and learning websites using advanced mathematical algorithms. It combines **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDM)** with an **adaptive Elo rating system** to provide fair, objective, and mathematically sound comparisons.

Perfect for computer science teachers, coding bootcamp instructors, and educational institutions looking to implement systematic evaluation methods for student web development projects.
